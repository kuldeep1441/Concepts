A virtual function in C++ is a member function in a base class that you expect to be overridden in derived classes. When you use a virtual function, it allows for dynamic (run-time) polymorphism, meaning the function that gets executed is determined at runtime based on the type of the object being pointed to, rather than the type of the pointer.

Key Concepts of Virtual Functions:
Declared in Base Class: A function is declared as virtual in the base class using the virtual keyword.
Overridden in Derived Class: A derived class can override this function to provide its specific implementation.
Dynamic Binding (Run-time Polymorphism): When a base class pointer or reference points to a derived class object, the derived class's version of the function is called, not the base class's, thanks to dynamic binding.
Use of Virtual Table (vtable): Behind the scenes, C++ maintains a table (vtable)
to ensure the correct function is called at runtime.

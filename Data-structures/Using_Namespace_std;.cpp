The statement using namespace std; in C++ is a directive that tells the compiler to look for names (e.g., variables, functions, classes) in the std (standard) namespace by default. This allows you to avoid repeatedly writing std:: before every standard library entity like cout, cin, string, etc.

Explanation:
In C++, namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and prevent name collisions. The standard library (such as iostream, string, vector, etc.) is encapsulated within the std namespace.

When you write using namespace std;, it eliminates the need to prepend std:: to every standard library name

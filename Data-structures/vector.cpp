// Vector :  dynamic size continuous block of memory used to store element of same data type;

//     Vectors are dynamic,
//     meaning they can grow or shrink in size.While vectors also use contiguous memory,
//     when the size exceeds the current capacity, vectors internally allocate a larger block of memory and move(copy) the elements to this new block.


// BENIFITS OF VECTOR OVER ARRAY

// Dynamic size
// rich library function(find, erase, insert)
// no need to paas size

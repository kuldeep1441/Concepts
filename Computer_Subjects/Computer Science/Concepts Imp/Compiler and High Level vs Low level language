A high-level programming language is closer to human language and abstracts away much of the hardware details, making it easier to read, write, and maintain. Examples include Python, Java, and C++. These languages handle memory management, have rich libraries, and provide simpler syntax.

A low-level programming language is closer to machine language and gives more control over hardware resources. It typically requires a deep understanding of the computer's architecture. Examples include Assembly and Machine Code. These languages are faster but more complex to program in.


Translator convert high level language code to low level language code

there are 2 type of translator
1. compiler    2. Interpretor


 
1. Compiler ( convert code into executable code ( binary code) and file formet is .exe and this executable file can be run on any window machine)

A compiler is a software tool that translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code or an intermediate code that can be understood and executed by a computer.

How a Compiler Works:
Lexical Analysis: The compiler reads the source code and breaks it into tokens (keywords, operators, identifiers, etc.).
Syntax Analysis: It checks if the token sequence follows the grammatical rules of the programming language (syntax checking).
Semantic Analysis: The compiler ensures the logic of the code makes sense, checking for errors like type mismatches or undefined variables.
Optimization: It optimizes the code for performance, reducing memory usage or improving speed.
Code Generation: The optimized code is converted into machine code (binary) or intermediate code.
Code Linking: The machine code is linked with libraries and other modules to create an executable program.
The final output is a file that the computer's processor can directly execute.




RELATIONSHIP BW C/C++ WITH COMPILER

C and C++ are both compiled languages, meaning that they rely on a compiler to translate their high-level code into machine code that a computer can execute.

Relationship between C/C++ and Compiler:
Compilation Process: When you write code in C or C++, the compiler translates it into an executable program by following the steps of lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.

Portability: The use of a compiler allows C/C++ programs to be portable across different systems. The same C/C++ source code can be compiled on various platforms (Windows, Linux, etc.), producing platform-specific executables.

Efficiency: C and C++ compilers are known for producing highly efficient, low-level machine code. This makes them suitable for system-level programming, where performance is critical.

Error Checking: The C/C++ compiler also checks for syntax errors, type safety, and other programming mistakes before generating an executable, providing useful debugging information.

In short, the compiler is essential for converting C/C++ source code into an executable form that the system's processor can run efficiently.











2. Interpreter

An interpreter is a program that directly executes code written in a high-level programming language without converting it into machine code beforehand. Unlike a compiler, which translates the entire program into machine code and then runs it, an interpreter processes the code line by line at runtime.

Key Features of an Interpreter:
Line-by-Line Execution: The interpreter reads, analyzes, and executes each line of code one at a time. This means the program can be run immediately, but it's generally slower than a compiled program.

No Intermediate Machine Code: An interpreter does not produce an intermediate machine code or executable file. Instead, it directly executes the source code.

Interactive Execution: Some interpreted languages (like Python) allow interactive execution, meaning you can run commands one by one, which is useful for testing and debugging.

Slower Execution: Since interpreters translate and execute code line by line, they are typically slower than compiled languages, where the code is already optimized and converted to machine language.

Examples of Interpreted Languages:
Python
JavaScript
Ruby
PHP
In short, an interpreter executes code on the fly without pre-compilation, making it useful for rapid development but generally less efficient in terms of runtime speed compared to compiled languages.




MinGW  allow us to use C/C++ compiler in windows

MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) is a free and open-source software development environment that allows you to use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) to compile C, C++, and other programming languages on Windows. It provides the necessary tools to compile native Windows applications without requiring a separate runtime environment like Cygwin.

What MinGW Does:
Compiles Code: MinGW allows you to compile C/C++ code using the GCC compiler on Windows. It converts your source code into a Windows executable.

Toolchain: MinGW includes essential tools like:

gcc (C compiler)
g++ (C++ compiler)

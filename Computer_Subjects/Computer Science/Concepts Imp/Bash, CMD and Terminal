********1. Command Prompt (CMD)

Command Prompt (CMD) in Windows is primarily used for performing system-level tasks and running simple scripts through text-based commands. It allows users to interact with the operating system without a graphical user interface (GUI). Here are its basic uses:

1. File and Directory Management:
Navigate through directories using commands like cd (change directory).
List files with dir.
Create, copy, move, and delete files with commands like copy, move, and del.


2. Running Programs and Scripts:
You can launch executable programs (e.g., notepad.exe).
Run batch scripts (files with .bat extension) for automating tasks.


3. Network Configuration:
Check network connectivity using ping, ipconfig, and netstat.
Configure network settings like IP addresses with commands like netsh.


CMD (Command Prompt) is the default terminal on Windows, specifically designed to run Windows commands, batch scripts, and manage the system through text-based input.





****2. Terminal
Definition: A terminal is a software that provides access to a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the Operatin system.
Working:
On Windows, terminals like Windows Terminal allow access to multiple shells like Command Prompt, PowerShell, and Bash.

Terminal is a general term for any text-based interface that allows you to interact with the system by typing commands. It can be used for running scripts, system commands, and managing files.



3. Bash on Windows (via WSL)
Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is primarily used as a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the operating system. It's a powerful tool for automating tasks, managing files, and executing system commands. Here's what Bash is mainly used for:

Working:
WSL creates a Linux-like environment on Windows, allowing you to run Bash as if you were on Linux.
When using Bash on Windows, you can run Linux commands (e.g., ls, grep, chmod) and scripts directly within the Windows OS.

Bash is native to Linux/macOS, but you can use it on Windows via WSL or third-party tools like Git Bash.

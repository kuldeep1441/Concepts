1. Volatile vs Non-Volatile Memory:

Volatile: Loses data when power is off (e.g., RAM).
Non-Volatile: Retains data when power is off (e.g., ROM, SSD)



1. Registers:
Location: Inside the CPU.
Speed: Fastest memory in the hierarchy.
Size: Smallest (typically a few bytes to a few kilobytes).
Purpose: Stores the most frequently used data for immediate processing (e.g., operands for arithmetic operations).
Example: Program Counter (PC), Accumulator, and general-purpose registers.


2. Cache Memory:
Location: Between the CPU and RAM, often integrated into the CPU.
Speed: Very fast, but slightly slower than registers.
Size: Larger than registers but smaller than RAM.
Purpose: Stores frequently accessed data and instructions to reduce the time it takes to access data from main memory (RAM).
Levels:
L1 Cache: Closest to the CPU, smallest (few KBs), fastest.
L2 Cache: Larger (hundreds of KB to a few MBs), slightly slower.
L3 Cache: Shared across CPU cores, larger (up to tens of MBs), and slower than L1 and L2.


3. Main Memory (RAM):     (to store program under execution)
Location: Separate from the CPU but directly accessible by it.
Speed: Slower than cache but faster than secondary storage.
Size: Much larger than cache memory (gigabytes).
Purpose: Temporarily stores data and programs currently in use by the CPU. Volatile, meaning it loses data when powered off.
Types: DRAM (Dynamic RAM), which is slower but used for larger main memory; SRAM (Static RAM) is used in cache


4. Secondary Storage:
Location: External to the CPU (e.g., HDD, SSD).
Speed: Slowest in the hierarchy.
Size: Largest (terabytes and beyond).
Purpose: Permanent storage of data, programs, and files. Non-volatile, meaning data persists even when the system is powered off.
Types:
HDD (Hard Disk Drive): Mechanical storage, slower but cheaper.
SSD (Solid-State Drive): Faster than HDDs, no moving parts, more expensive.



Summary of Relationship:
Registers: Fastest but smallest, handles immediate CPU data (operands).
Cache (L1, L2, L3): Stores recently used data to speed up CPU operations.
Main Memory (RAM): General-purpose temporary storage for active programs and data.
Secondary Storage: Large, permanent data storage for files and applications.
This hierarchical organization optimizes performance by storing critical data closer to the CPU.

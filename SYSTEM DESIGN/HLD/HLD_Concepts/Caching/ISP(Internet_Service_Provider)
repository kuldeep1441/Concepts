Every time you access the internet (Netflix, Instagram, YouTube, etc.), your internet traffic must pass through your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
The ISP is the bridge between your device and the global internet.


Role of ISP in Netflix’s Edge Caching:
Normally, ISP just routes packets.
But Netflix deploys Open Connect servers inside ISP’s data centers.
This means popular Netflix content is already inside the ISP’s network, so:
The video does not travel across the internet → lower latency.
ISP just streams it from its local cache.

So What Happens When You Open Netflix?
You enter netflix.com or open the app.
Your request goes through your ISP first because:
Your ISP manages your internet connection.
It routes DNS queries and your traffic to Netflix.
If the ISP has Netflix Open Connect servers, it serves content locally.
If not, ISP forwards your request to Netflix’s global CDN or data center.

User Device → ISP → (Netflix Open Connect Cache in ISP) → Stream video
OR
User Device → ISP → Global Internet → Netflix Data Center

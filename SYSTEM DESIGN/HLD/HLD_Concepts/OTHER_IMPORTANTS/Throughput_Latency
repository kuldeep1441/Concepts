| Aspect      | Throughput                          | Latency                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Definition  | Work done (processed) per unit tim  | Time taken for a single request |
| Measurement | Requests/sec, Transactions/sec      | Milliseconds or seconds         |
| Focus       | System capacity (volume)            | User experience (speed)         |
| Relation    | High throughput = more work handled | Low latency = faster responses  |


Throttling means slowing down or limiting how often something can happen so the system doesnâ€™t get overloaded.

Definitions:

HTTP is a standard protocol (**request-response**) for transmitting data over the internet, following a request-response model where the client initiates the request and the server responds.

REST is an architecture(**set of rules**) that generally uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) along with resource paths to interact with resources.
Example: GET /users/1 fetches the user whose ID is 1.

REST API is an API that follows REST architecture â€” using HTTP methods and paths to allow two software systems to communicate/interact with each other.

Simplified Representation:
**REST Architecture = HTTP Methods + Resource Paths**


Memory Aid:
HTTP = language for talking.
REST = Architecture(**set of rules**) for having a proper conversation using that language.

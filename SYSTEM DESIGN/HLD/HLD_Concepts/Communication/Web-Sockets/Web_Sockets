What is a WebSocket?
A WebSocket is a protocol that enables full-duplex communication (two-way) between a client (browser, app) and a server over a single TCP connection. (And It's also Sticky so one client's request goes to one server only.)
Unlike HTTP, which is request-response, WebSocket allows **real-time bidirectional communication**.
Once a WebSocket connection is established, the client and server can send messages to each other anytime, without reopening connections.

How WebSockets Work
Step 1: Handshake
Client sends an HTTP request to the server then
Server responds then
After this “handshake”, the protocol switches from HTTP to WebSocket.

This is why it’s sometimes called an “HTTP Upgrade”.

Step 2: Data Transmission
Data is sent in frames:
Text frames (UTF-8)
Binary frames (images, blobs, etc.)
Close frames (to terminate connection)

**Messages can be pushed by server without client request → real-time updates.**

Step 3: Closing Connection
Either client or server can send a close frame.
Connection is terminated gracefully.

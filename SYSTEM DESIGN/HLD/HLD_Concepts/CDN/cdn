CDN : Stands for content delivery network
Stores static data and API responses to reduce load on the server and improve responses time.

Why use CDN instead of serving directly from S3?
Faster Delivery: CDN caches files on edge servers near users, reducing latency. (Geographically closer)
Better Scalability: Handles high traffic without overloading S3.
Lower Costs: Fewer S3 requests and reduced data transfer from origin.
Improved Security: Built-in DDoS protection, HTTPS, and WAF.

S3 as origin + CDN = Best Performance & Cost Efficiency.

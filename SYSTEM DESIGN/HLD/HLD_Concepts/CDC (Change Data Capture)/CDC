DB → CDC Connector → Kafka → Consumers (e.g., Data Warehouse, Analytics, Microservices)

What is CDC?
Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique used to track and capture changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) in a database in real-time or near real-time. Instead of processing the entire dataset repeatedly, CDC identifies and delivers only the changes since the last capture, making data replication and synchronization efficient.

Why Use CDC?
✅ Real-Time Data Synchronization – Keep multiple systems (e.g., OLTP DB → Data Warehouse) in sync.
✅ Event-Driven Architecture – Trigger downstream processes based on data changes.
✅ ETL Optimization – Extract only changed data, reducing resource consumption.
✅ Auditing & Compliance – Maintain a log of data modifications.

How CDC Works
CDC captures changes through one of the following methods:

1. Log-Based CDC (Recommended)
Reads the database transaction logs (e.g., MySQL binlog, PostgreSQL WAL, MongoDB oplog).
Pros: Low overhead, near real-time, scalable.
Cons: Requires access to DB logs.

2. Trigger-Based CDC
Database triggers track changes and write them to a change table.
Pros: Works on all databases.
Cons: Adds overhead on write operations.

3. Polling with Timestamps
Queries records using an updated_at column to find recent changes.
Pros: Simple to implement.
Cons: High load on large datasets, not truly real-time.

CDC Tools & Frameworks
**Debezium (Kafka-based CDC for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)**
**AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)**
Oracle GoldenGate
SQL Server CDC
StreamSets

CDC Architecture Example
Scenario: MySQL → Kafka → Data Warehouse

Application updates data in MySQL.
CDC reads changes from MySQL binlog.
Changes are published to a Kafka topic via Debezium connector.
A consumer service processes these events and stores them in a Data Warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery).

Benefits of CDC
Reduces network and compute load.
Enables real-time analytics.
Improves efficiency for large datasets.

Clustering vs Replication vs Sharding:

✅ 1. Clustering
Definition: Multiple database servers (nodes) work together as one logical system to improve availability, performance, and fault tolerance.
Goal: High availability + load balancing.
Data Distribution: All nodes usually have the same data (or synchronized view).
Example:
MySQL Galera Cluster

✅ 2. Replication
Definition: Copying data from one database server (primary) to one or more secondary servers.
Goal: Read scalability and backup.
Data Distribution: Full copy of data on each replica.
Types:
Master-Slave (Writes → Master, Reads → Slave)
Master-Master (Writes on multiple masters)
Example:
MySQL Replication

✅ 3. Sharding
Definition: Splitting a large dataset into smaller chunks (shards) across multiple servers.
Goal: Horizontal scalability for very large datasets.
Data Distribution: Each shard stores only a subset of the data.
Example:
MongoDB Sharded Cluster

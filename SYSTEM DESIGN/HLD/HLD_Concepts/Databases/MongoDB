Open source database (Mongodb now supports ACID property)


(
Connection Pool in MongoDB :
Our (Driver) maintains a TCP/TLS pool (connection pool to avoid 3 way handshake + tear-down work)
Authentication (username/password, SSL).
)

(
Delete V/S Soft Delete :
Delete : causes the B+ tree to rebalance and the the deleted thing can't be re-accessed
Soft Delete : adding a key of isDeleted which show the data is soft deleted.

**What is a MongoDB Cluster?**
A MongoDB Cluster is a group of MongoDB servers (nodes) working together to provide scalability, availability, and fault tolerance for large-scale applications.


MongoDB supports two major types of clusters:

1. Replica Set (Replication Cluster)
A replica set is a cluster of MongoDB servers that store the same data.
Used for high availability and redundancy.

Components:
Primary Node: Handles all write operations.
Secondary Nodes: Replicate data from the primary and can serve read requests.
Arbiter (Optional): Helps in election during failover.
Goal: If the primary fails, a secondary becomes primary (automatic failover).

2. Sharded Cluster
A sharded cluster is used to distribute data across multiple servers for horizontal scalability.
Components:
Shards: Each shard stores a subset of data.
Config Servers: Store metadata about the cluster (which shard has which data).
mongos (Query Router): Routes client queries to the correct shard(s).
Goal: Handle huge datasets and high write throughput by splitting data.

Client → mongos → [Shard1, Shard2, Shard3]

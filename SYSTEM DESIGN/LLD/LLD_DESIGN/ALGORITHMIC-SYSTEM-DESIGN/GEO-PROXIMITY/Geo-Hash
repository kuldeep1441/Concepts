What is Geohash?
Geohash encodes latitude/longitude into a short Base32 string, enabling efficient storage and spatial queries.

Longer hash → higher precision.
Prefixes represent larger regions.

Example:
28.6139, 77.2090 → t1v74sh (precision 7).

Precision Levels
Length	Cell Size (approx)	Use Case
3	150 km × 150 km	City-level
5	4.9 km × 4.9 km	Neighborhood
7	153 m × 153 m	Street/block
9	4.8 m × 4.8 m	Building-level

Advantages
Compact, index-friendly.
Works with prefix search for proximity.
Language-agnostic, widely supported.

Limitations
Not ideal for circular distance queries.
Edge issues across cell boundaries.
